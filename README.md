# AMF Socket - Actionscript

AMF Socket is a bi-directional RPC system for Adobe Flash (Actionscript) programs.
This library aims to make high quality and free RPC accessible to all of the Flash platforms (web, mobile, and desktop).
Using this library you can easily add event driven network functionality to your Flash applications without having to deal with the low level details.
High performance and low latency is accomplished through the use of persistent TCP/IP sockets and Flash's native serialization format (AMF).

## Example (Higher level AMF RPC layer)

This is the API layer you normally use in your applications.
It hides all of the networking details and presents you with a simple API for making requests to your server.

    var manager:RpcManager = new RpcManager('localhost', 9000);

    manager.addEventListener(RpcManagerEvent.CONNECTED, function(event:RpcManagerEvent):void {
      var request:RpcRequest = new RpcRequest('hello', {'someData': ['foobar', 5]});

      request.addEventListener(RpcRequestEvent.SUCCEEDED, function(event:RpcRequestEvent):void {
        trace('success');
      });

      request.addEventListener(RpcRequestEvent.FAILED, function(event:RpcRequestEvent):void {
        trace('failure');
      });

      manager.deliver(request);
    });

    manager.connect();

## Example (lower level AMF socket layer)

The lower layer is responsible for sending and receiving messages over the network.
You normally you should let the RPC layer take care of these lower level details for you.

    var sock:AmfSocket = new AmfSocket('localhost', 9000);
    sock.addEventListener(AmfSocketEvent.CONNECTED, function(event:AmfSocketEvent):void {
      trace('connected');
      sock.sendObject({'someData': ['foobar', 5]});
    });

    sock.addEventListener(AmfSocketEvent.DISCONNECTED, function(event:AmfSocketEvent):void {
      trace('disconnected');
    });

    sock.addEventListener(AmfSocketEvent.IO_ERROR, function(event:AmfSocketEvent):void {
      trace('io error');
    });

    sock.addEventListener(AmfSocketEvent.RECEIVED_OBJECT, function(event:AmfSocketEvent):void {
      trace('received object');
    });

    sock.addEventListener(AmfSocketEvent.SECURITY_ERROR, function(event:AmfSocketEvent):void {
      trace('security error');
    });

    sock.connect();

## Server Implementations

* [Ruby](https://github.com/chadrem/amf_socket_ruby)

## Wire Protocol

Each message has a 4 byte header followed by a variable length payload encoded in AMF verison 3.
The header contains a single unsigned int that indicates the length (in bytes) of the payload.
All messages use big-endian byte ordering.
